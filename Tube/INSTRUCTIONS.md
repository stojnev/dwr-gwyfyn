# Tonearm Tube

This section deals with assembling the tonearm tube, in multiple configurations. Please refer to the individual assembly diagrams found in the `/Assemblies/` folder.

## Parts

There are two sets of parts, depending on configuration. The first set is needed regardless of configuration, the latter based on preference.

### Mounting Peripherals

- A - Bearing Mount - Flexure Mount Bottom.stl
- B - Bearing Mount - Flexure Mount Cap.stl
- C - Tube - Finger Lift Curved.stl

Print one of each, but print two of part B (mount cap).

### Tube Effective Length + Offset

There are two groups of parts based on the inclusion of bearing offset. Within those two groups, there are three individual configurations, based on effective length, and 9", 10" and 12" at that.

First you select either `/Bearing Offset/` for typical tonearms, or `/No Offset/` for tonearms with no bearing offset.

Once you do that, select either `/9 Inches/`, `/10 Inches/` or `/12 Inches/` based on effective length preference.

And once inside either of those folders, print one each of the following:

- D - Tube - Tonearm Stub.stl
- E - Tube - Tonearm Tube.stl

## Print Settings

All parts are printed using PLA, with the following settings:

- Layer Height: 0.16mm
- Initial Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Wall Loops: 6
- Top Shell Layers: 6
- Infill Density: 15%
- Infill Pattern: Honeycomb
- Supports: Minimal

## Tools

- CA Glue
- Xacto Knife
- Needle Nose Pliers

## Assemblies


1. Print parts A, B (two of these), C, D, and E.
2. Ensure that all internal suports within D and E have been removed. Use needle nose pliers if need be.
3. Glue D to E with a thin layer of CA glue, taking note that the wiring hole is not obstructed.
4. Take the counterweight slider found in the Counterweight assembly and glue it to the bottom of D using a thin layer of CA glue.
5. Once dried, take the circular flexure printed earlier, and press it within the section formerly known as E, now an integral part of the tube. There are pins on the underside of said sections, and openings on the circular flexure for proper locating.
6. Take A and press it to the underside of the flexure, and hold it in place.
7. Take both caps (B) and screw them on either side carefully noting the threads so that parallelism is maintained. These are internal threads so take extra care.
8. Once done, the flexure should be free to rotate and be visible from the openings in the caps.
9. Now take the entire assembly and push it onto the vertical flexure mount from the Pillar assembly.
10. If needed, glue C to the front of the tonearm tube in the locator hole.


At this point, you should have all printed and mounted parts, and proceed with wiring.
