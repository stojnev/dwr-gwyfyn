### Tonearm Pillar

This assembly holds the two vertical bearings together and provides an interface to the tonearm tube and horisontal bearings.

See `/Assemblies/Tonearm Pillar` for reference.

1. Print all parts.
2. Press the two bearings on each side of B. Make sure that the bearings are level - use a level surface to help install. Ensure free running.
3. Push C through the openings of the two bearings. It may be a tight fit, ensure that the bearings stay in place. Ensure free running.
4. Tap A and D on the preset holes using an M3 tap. This is optional and you may not need it depending on printer settings.
5. Screw D to the bottom thread of C once installed in B. Ensure free running. You are to use this cap as a setting for preload.
6. Once done, press A on the top of C using the pilot guides. Ensure free running. Ensure level positioning by checking runout.

You can now insert the entire assembly in the clamp mount of your choice.
