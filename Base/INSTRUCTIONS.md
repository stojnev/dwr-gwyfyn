## Assemblies

### SME Fixed Clamp Mount

This assembly has the capability of a tapered clamp mount for the tonearm pillar, but NO provisions for tonearm height change, and NO provision for overhang change via slider.

See `/Assemblies/SME Fixed Clamp Mount` for reference.

1. Print parts E, J and K.
2. Locate J on the top protrusion of E, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
3. Once dried, screw provisionally K on top of J.

This will allow for compression of J via K and thus provide a clamping mount.

### SME Fixed VTA Clamp Mount

This assembly has the capability of a tapered clamp mount for the tonearm pillar, built-in tonearm height change, but NO provision for overhang change via slider.

See `/Assemblies/SME Fixed VTA Clamp Mount` for reference.

1. Print parts A, B, C, D, F, J and K.
2. Locate C on the top protrusion of D, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
3. Snap A on top of C;
4. Locate J on the top protrusion of B, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
5. Screw in the completed assembly from the previous step on the thread of A, noting it is a left hand thread.
6. Screw provisionally K on top of J.
7. Screw in F to the thread on D to allow for locking of the VTA assembly.

To clamp the tonearm, use the clamping mount.

To affect tonearm height, unscrew the lock bolt (F), turn in the adjustment collar (A) and after lock with the lock bolt.

### SME Sliding Clamp Mount

This assembly has the capability of a tapered clamp mount for the tonearm pillar, provision for overhang change via slider, but NO built-in tonearm height change.

See `/Assemblies/SME Sliding Clamp Mount` for reference.

1. Print parts G, H, J and K.
2. Locate J on the top protrusion of H, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
3. Use an M3 tap on the side of G for the set screw and insert a M3 set screw.
4. Slide the assembly with the base of H within the dovetail slot of G.

To clamp the tonearm, use the clamping mount.

### SME Sliding VTA Clamp Mount

This assembly has the capability of a tapered clamp mount for the tonearm pillar, provision for overhang change via slider, and built-in tonearm height change.

See `/Assemblies/SME Sliding VTA Clamp Mount` for reference.

1. Print parts A, B, C, F, I, J and K.
2. Locate C on the top protrusion of I, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
3. Snap A on top of C;
4. Locate J on the top protrusion of B, and glue with a thin layer of CA glue.
5. Screw in the completed assembly from the previous step on the thread of A, noting it is a left hand thread.
6. Screw provisionally K on top of J.
7. Use an M3 tap on the side of G for the set screw and insert a M3 set screw.
8. Slide the assembly with the base of H within the dovetail slot of I.
