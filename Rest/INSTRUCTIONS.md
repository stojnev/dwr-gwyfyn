### Tonearm Rest

Before printing, you need to decide if you want to have a DIN output connector, or a pair of RCAs. For option one, select I. For option two, select J.

See `/Assemblies/Tonearm Rest Modular` for reference.

1. Print all parts, and either I or J depending on your preferences.
2. Glue C to the bottom of I or J, in the designated depression.
3. Screw everything together, all of the parts are different.
4. Slide F on the dovetail of G.
5. Press E through the hole on G and screw on to the threads of F - this is a left hand thread.
6. Make sure that H points to the outside of the tonearm, on the side of the skating force compensation assembly.
7. Once done, take the bearing pillar out of the clamp and slide it throught he tonearm rest from the top, gently screwing it with care to the threads.

You can now insert the entire assembly in the clamp mount of your choice.
