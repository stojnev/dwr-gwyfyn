# Spindle Distance Jig

This section deals with setting up a spindle distance jig, to properly set pivot-to-spindle distance.

## Parts

There are two sets of parts, depending on configuration. The first set is needed regardless of configuration, the latter based on preference.

### Mounting Peripherals

- A - Spindle Distance Jig - Locator Pin.stl
- B - Spindle Distance Jig - Spindle Adapter.stl
- C - Spindle Distance Jig - Support Column.stl

Print one of each.

### Tube Effective Length

There are three files, depending on chosen effective length, meaning 9", 10" or 12". It makes no difference if there is any or no bearing offset.

- D - Spindle Distance Jig - Alignment Jig 9-.stl
- E - Spindle Distance Jig - Alignment Jig 10-.stl
- F - Spindle Distance Jig - Alignment Jig 12-.stl

- Layer Height: 0.16mm
- Initial Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Wall Loops: 6

## Assemblies


1. Print parts A, B, and C.
2. Print one of D, E or F depending on preference.
3. Screw B on the threaded end of your chosen jig from the previous step, all the way down.
4. Screw C on the middle portion in the threaded hole, but leave it loose.
5. Place B over your turntable spindle.
6. Unscrew C as needed in order to have the entire jig parallel to the platter.
7. Put A through either of the holes on the unsupported end of your chosen jig.
8. The thin end of the locator pin should slot neatly in the flexure mount on the tonearm pillar.
