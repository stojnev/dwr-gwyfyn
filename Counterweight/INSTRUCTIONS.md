### Tonearm Counterweight

There are two parts to the counterweight, and two others for the slide. The counterweight is designed to slide in a dovetail and lock using a thumbscrew.

See `/Assemblies/Counterweight` for reference.

1. Print all parts.
2. Tap B on the preset hole using an M3 tap. This is optional and you may not need it if you glue the counterweight.
3. Put C and D aside - you will need them for the tube assembly.
4. Fill in some or all of the chambers of the counterweight body with leadshot.
5. Place A on top of B and either screw it with the M3 screw or glue it with a thin layer of CA glue.
6. Test out the dovetail and the thumbscrew to ensure smooth movement.

## Notes

The counterweight should be loosely filled. Leadshot is excellent in this manner, but it should not be packed - there is some performance to be gained from having the lead shot somewhat loose.

There is no way to accurately determine the amount of lead shot beforehand, as it varies in the type of lead shot you select, the effective length of the tonearm and additional factors. The main rule of thumb is to start with a few chambers, and add slowly until you reach a point where you have good travel of the counterweight.

Experimentation is key here.

This is why a screw could be suitable in the beginning, but once the proper amount of lead shot is determined, I recommend gluing the counterweight parts together.
