# dŵr-gŵyfyn

"dŵr-gŵyfyn" ("gŵyfyn") is a complete turntable tonearm designed for additive manufacturing, geared towards the highest performance. The project provides a set of models, ready-to-print settings and instructions for printing and assembling a full tonearm.

# Mounting

This is an approximate dimension diagram to understand if the tonearm will fit your requirements and space.

Please note that only height dimensions are provided since the tonearm can be printed in 9", 10" and 12" configurations.

# Order

The assemblies can be printed all at once, but it is recommended to print and assemble them in order which facilitates (I think) an easier completion.

The recommended order is as follows:

1. Base;
2. Pillar;
3. Rest;
4. Counterweight;
5. Flexures;
6. Tube.
